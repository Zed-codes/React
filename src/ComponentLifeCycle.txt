Stateful components are the only components that have access to lifestyle hooks.

lifestyle Hooks:
constructor()                   componentWillMount()
componentWillReceiveProps()     shouldComponentUpdate()
componentWillUpdate()           componentDidUpdate()
componentDidCatch()             componentDidMount()
componentWillUnmount()          render()

Not all methods are executed during creating, only: 
1) constructor (ES6 class Feature, not React)
Do: Set up State
DON'T: Cause Side-Effects (like calling a website to change the state)
After the constructor the next function will execute >>>

2) componentWillMount (React method,exists for historic reasons, unlikely we will use it).
Do: Update State, last minute Optimization
Don't: Cause Side-Effects
After the componentWillMount, the next function will execute >>>

3) Render (doesn't access the real DOM)
Defines how the component will look like from a HTML perspective. Compares the 
virtual DOM and the real DOM and will only update the changes.
It will then Render all Child Components within the components.
After this, the next method will be executed...

4) componentDidMount checks that everything was assembled correctrly
Do: Cause Side-Effects
Don't: Update State (triggers re-render)
